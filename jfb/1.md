# JavaScript for beginners <span style="color: green;">#1</span>
Welcome to this post, we're going to cover some of the things you can expect during this series. It's a high-level overview of the language, how we use it and all the things that come along with it.

> These posts are written for the absolute beginner. It will probably bore you if you have more than a few months of experience in JavaScript.

## Getting started
JavaScript has a specific process attached to it; and when we write JavaScript we have to think in a specific way. If I just start off by telling you about terms like 'variables', 'functions' etc. and start writing the code to show it to you, I'll be doing you an injustice. When I started writing code it took a while for me to make sense of what I was writing and I totally attribute that to myself. I did courses above my level of skill, way above. This did push me to learn quickly, but I didn't really understand WHAT I was learning.

## Javascript in it's raw form and purpose
I'm assuming that if you're a complete beginner to JavaScript you may be quite early in your *HTML* and *CSS* career too. This isn't a series about that so I'm not going to get too deep on those. But here's a quick rundown on what they are:

### HTML
Hypertext Markup Language - is not a programming language. It's a language used to add elements to a page that is readable by your web browser.

e.g. This is what HTML tags look like.
```html
<nav>A common tag used for navigation bars.</nav>
<input type="text"> 
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```

The above example shows what common HTML tags look like. They create the skeleton of your page. It's usually ugly too, that's why we have...

### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets - Also not a programming language, but a way to style our HTML elements. It looks like this:
```CSS
nav {
    background: blue;
    color: white;
}
```
The *nav* 'selector' is going to find the nav element on the page and apply those styles to it.
If you want to learn more about HTML and CSS there are many, many free resources like [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com) that you can use to learn from.

### That brings me to JavaScript
In it's most raw form, JavaScript was created to add functionality to the page. *What does functionality mean in this context?*
Well think of it as finding elements on the page and then changing, deleting, storing or sending it somewhere. JavaScript however has become much more than this basic use. We will learn about the power that JavaScript has achieved in it's short existence soon, but here's...

## An example of JavaScript in action

### Let's first create an HTML element and style it.
```HTML
<div id="box">

</div>

<style>
    #box {
        width: 200px;
        height: 200px;
        background: purple;
    }
</style>
```
There's quite a bit going on there if you're a beginner. But essentially the *div* is an html element that creates space for elements to live in. It does not inherently do anything on the page except reserve space, until you add elements inside or add styling to it. We're adding styling by giving it an 'id' attribute. This we can do with every html element. It's very useful for CSS and JavaScript, because it allows us to target these elements.

This is what that looks like: 

<div style="width: 200px;height: 200px;background: purple;"></div>

### Using Javascript to move the object
We'll write some JavaScript now to move this block from left to right. Don't worry too much about the syntax (The words and characters) now. We'll cover that. This just an example of what JavaScript can do. I'll try and comment some stuff as I go, comments look like `// This` and aren't read by your browser.

```js 
// Create a variable that holds all the information about the box element on the page.
var box = document.getElementById('box');

// Initial position
var i = 0;

// Wait 1 second for page to load
setTimeout(() => {

    // Every half asecond
    setInterval(() => {
        // Move twenty pixels
        i += 20
        if(i > 200) {
            // reset position after 200px
            i = 0
        } 
        // Adding the movement
        box.style.marginLeft = i +'px';
    }, 500)
}, 1000)
```
And that looks like:

<div id="box2" style="width: 200px;height: 200px;background: purple;"></div>

<script async>
 var i = 2;

setTimeout(() => {
    var box = document.querySelector('#box2');

const interval = setInterval(() => {
    i += 20
    if(i > 200) {
        i = 0
    } 
    box.style.marginLeft = i +'px';
}, 500)
}, 1000)

</script>

## How to see your code/structure your files.

```
Your files should look like this:

- folder
| -- index.html
| -- main.js
```

If you open index.html with [Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) you'll see the results. But please check out the structure of an html page first.

> Thank You for reading this first post, I hope it's a bit clearer to you what it is that we do with JavaScript.
